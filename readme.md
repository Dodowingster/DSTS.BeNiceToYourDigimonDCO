## **Overview: Finally, Partners with Personality!**

Have you ever wished your Digimon felt less like a battle unit and more like a true, distinct partner? Did it ever pissed you off how most of your options to keep your Digimon Personality the same is by being a douchebag?

**Be Nice to Your Mon - DCO (Dialogue Chat Overhaul)** is a massive mod that completely rewrites and expands the in-game dialogue system for *Digimon Story: Time Stranger*. By tapping into the game's existing personality mechanics, this mod ensures that every Digimon feels unique, expressive, and truly *yours*.

I am replacing generic, repetitive dialogue with thousands of new lines that reflect the bond between Agent and Digimon, adding emotional depth and humor back into the Digital World.

~~**⚠️ IMPORTANT W.I.P. NOTE:** This mod is currently **Work in Progress (1400 / 3200 dialogues complete).** Please understand that some dialogue may still be the original, "vanilla-boring" text.~~

AS OF RIGHT NOW, ONLY **ENGLISH LANGUAGE** IS THE ONLY ONE SUPPORTED. IF YOU WANT TO TRANSLATE, FEEL FREE TO DO SO. YOU HAVE MY FULL PERMISSION.

### **Core Features**

#### **1. Dialogue Driven by Personality**
Your Digimon's core personality now dictates *how* they speak, not just what stats they prefer:

* **Valor (Courage)** Digimon might greet you with a bold challenge or boast about their strength; **it loves to train and push its limits.**
* **Philanthropy (Love)** Digimon will ask questions about your day and express genuine care; **it secretly craves your affection.**
* **Amicability (Friendship)** Digimon is laid-back and casual, **often cracking jokes to ease tension.**
* **Wisdom** Digimon will offer tactical insights or muse philosophically; **be careful—this Digimon is sly and a bookworm.**

#### **2. Overhauled Chat Bubbles**
The subtle partner conversations you trigger after battles now contain completely new questions, comments, and reactions that reflect your Digimon's current personality. This greatly increases the variety and relevance of every interaction.

#### **3. New Character Voice and Humor**
Enjoy dialogue that is richer, funnier, and more self-aware than the vanilla experience. Inspired by the sharp writing of classic *Digimon* anime and modern monster-taming games, I've injected genuine character and levity into thousands of dialogues. Look out for **strong pop-culture references** as well—it's up to you to find them!

#### **4. Seamless Integration**
This mod works entirely within the existing game framework, modifying text files to give the illusion of a deeper, more emotional connection with your Digimon partner without changing any core gameplay mechanics or statistics.

#### **5. Team Camaraderie and Awareness**
The dialogue is written manually, so there may be occasional typos (feel free to report them!). Most importantly, I've ensured your Digimon are **aware of each other** and will **reference other team members** in their conversations, truly building a sense of camaraderie.
